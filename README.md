# Assembler
This is a large-scale project in the C language that I wrote during my university studies.
We were asked to write an assembler - software that receives source files in assembly language and converts it to binary and even more to the base 32 that was defined for us.

TO run this program on Linux system follow those steps-
1. Download the program to the Linux system.
2. Extract all the files from the zip.
3. Enter the Linux terminal, from the folder you extracted the files to, and run the following command - make.
4. Now in the terminal write the following command- ./assembler [the assembly source file you wish to convert]

Note- Example for step 4: ./assembler input1.as input2.as (as much file as you wish to convert)
Note- In the zip file you download, there is an assembly language source file for the experiment: 'input.as'
